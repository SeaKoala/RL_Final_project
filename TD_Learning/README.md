Model free TD(0) Learning for the game of 2048
	
* To train the RL agent (the tuple network will be saved to the directory tupleNet/)		
>	`python3 2048.py --play=n --train=on -e=5000 -a=0.0025 -r=0        

 # e is number of episodes to train which is 5000, 
 # -a is step size parameter alpha, 
 # r = 0 means sum based reward and r = 1 means empty cell based reward	
	
* To test the RL agent after training	
>	`python3 visualize_agent.py -r=0		
# r = 0 means sum based reward and r = 1 means empty cell based reward
